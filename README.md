# Sendator

## A Hackathon project for MHacks 2017! Trying to make it easier for people to stay involved in politics and contact their senators by providing fresh interfaces! It Tweets at your senators with the issues you care about, with both a voice and web interface to use

## This project was made mostly with node.js for the backend and for building the Alexa Skill. It utilizes the google Civics API and Twitter API. Give it a try!
